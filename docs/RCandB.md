##Questions to Consider

###What are the Goals of the Website?
	1. Information Hub
		-Calendar, About Page, 
	2. Fundraising Mechanism
	3. Ecommerce
	4. Delivery (?)
###Once it's built, who's going to maintain it?
	Important Question! This is one of the reasons I'd advocate for something like squarespace/wordpress
###How much are you willing to invest into this?
	Both financially and with your own time. Domain hosting, development, time spent are a few things to consider.
###What's the aesthetic?
	think color scheme, theme, and fonts, mood of photos, etc.

###Theme Suggestions:
[pacific][1] (squarespace/ online store):
	Large image design makes for a good opportunity to showcase food.
	
[brine][2] (squarespace/online store ): The scrollable design of the homepage focuses on content first. Each row has a lot of breathing room, and it gives you the chance to get the message of RC&B to your audience immediately.
